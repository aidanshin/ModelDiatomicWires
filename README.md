# Mathematically Modeling Diatomic and Monatomic Wires
The goal of this experiment is to find the optimal model to calculate resonant frequencies for certain wires. 

In this experiment, I collected data for three different scenarios:
- Monatomic Wire: Ten spherical equal masses spaced at an equal distance across a wire
- Diatomic Wire: Ten spherical masses spaced evenly across the steel wire, however the masses alternate between a small mass and a big mass
- Monatomic Wire with One Odd Mass: One mass for a Monatomic wire is changed to a different size

The goal was to mathematically model the scenarios to calculate the resonant frequencies by using a derived equation as well as a matrix to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
