In this lab, the resonant frequencies of a monatomic wire, a diatomic wire, and a monatomic wire with an oddball were calculated using an analytic expression and a matrix eigenvalue equation.

This lab examines a real macroscopic ball and spring model in order to experiment with resonant frequencies. More specifically a monatomic wire and a diatomic wire are looked at in a few different circumstances and compared to determine how the resonant frequencies are affected. Monatomic wires have just one type of ball while diatomic wires have alternating balls. It is interesting how the results differ once the balls on the diatomic wire are altered and when the mass of the wire itself is taken into consideration. In order to find these results an RCA stereo amplifier is used to pass output to a PASCO Driver which in turn will vibrate the wire and the PASCO detector picks up these resonant frequencies.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Theory</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to theoretically calculate the resonant frequencies for the monatomic wire, diatomic wire, and a monatomic wire with one odd mass, analytical expression and matrices had to be derived.

To estimate the expected resonant frequencies with a 10 by 10 matrix, equation (15) was used and the mass of the large ball, </span><span class="c2 c7">M</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was</span><img src="images/image29.png"><span class="c2">&nbsp;and the mass of the small mass, </span><span class="c2 c7">m</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span class="c0">. In the matrix, the masses for each column alternated from big to small masses. In Figure 6, the matrix is able to accurately calculate the mass&rsquo;s largest frequencies at modes 5 and 10. The reduced chi-squared was calculated using equation (17), where the collected resonant frequencies are compared to the matrix resonant frequencies. The reduced chi-squared was 0.513 with degrees of freedom being 9. However, this matrix and the theoretical expression do not take into account the mass of the wire. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">In order to account for the mass of the wire, the mass of the portion of the wire used needs to be calculated. Equation (16) is used to calculate the mass of the portion of the wire, where the length of the wire, </span><span class="c2 c7">L</span><span class="c2">, was 2.8 m, the mass of the wire, </span><span class="c2 c7">m</span><span class="c2 c4">a</span><span class="c2">, was 0.00159 kg, the length of the wire used, </span><span class="c2 c7">L</span><span class="c2 c4">used</span><span class="c2">, was 2.0 m and the number of portions the wire is dividing into, </span><span class="c2 c7">n</span><span class="c2">, was 30.

The sequence for the columns was </span><img src="images/image36.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;and was repeated 5 times, then multiplied to equation (15) to create a 30 by 30 matrix. These resonant frequencies compared to the collected data were consistent with a reduced chi-squared, calculated using equation (17), of 1.27. We expect the reduced chi-squared to be smaller for the matrix that accounts for the mass of the wire; however, this is not the case here. The reason for the discrepancy is that the wire has its own tension and when the wire is divided into small portions this tension is assumed to be negligible when it really does have an effect. If one is able to account for the tension of this wire, then this can help the accuracy of the model that takes into account the mass of the wire. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c0">In all, the matrix equation is able to calculate the higher resonant frequencies with shorter wavelengths, and therefore, the matrix calculations are more accurate compared to the theoretical expression. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c5">Monatomic Wire with One Odd Mass</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">For the monatomic wire with one odd mass, Figure 7 is the plot of the amplitude of the wire against the driving frequency.

These frequencies are compared to the expected values of resonant frequency which was calculated using the matrix relationship, equation (14). For the case where the mass of the wire is assumed massless, a 10 by 10 matrix, equation (15), with the fourth column having the mass of the small ball, </span><span class="c2 c7">m</span><span class="c2">, 0.00166</span><img src="images/image37.png"><span class="c2">&nbsp;kg, and the rest of the columns mass is the big ball, </span><span class="c2 c7">M</span><span class="c2">, 0.0022789</span><img src="images/image37.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;kg. These resonant frequencies that are calculated from this 10 by 10 matrix are represented by the orange dots, labeled &ldquo;Expected Values&rdquo;, in Figure 8. These resonant frequencies are compared to the collected data and the reduced chi-squared, calculated using equation (17), was 0.498. </span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c2">The resonant frequencies for the system were estimated using the matrix relationship but now accounting for the mass of the wire. This was done using a sequence of </span><img src="images/image38.png"><span class="c0">and was repeated 10 times by changing the big mass to the small mass at the 11th column. The resonant frequency that was calculated using this relationship is the green dots in Figure 8. The reduced chi-squared was calculated using equation (17) and was 0.867. Again, it was expected that the reduced chi-squared would be smaller for the model that took into account the mass of the wire, which our data has failed to show. The unique shape at the higher frequencies is due to the odd mass affecting the resonant frequencies that have antinodes occurring near the odd mass. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 404.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image45.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 404.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Figure 8: Plot of the resonant frequencies for the monatomic wire with one odd mass.

At larger frequencies, the expected curve becomes an underestimate because it does not account for the mass of the string. &nbsp;For the diatomic wire, the fitting curve estimated the fitting parameter to be </span><span class="c2 c7">A</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;= 69.208 </span><img src="images/image39.png"><span class="c2">&nbsp;0.786 Hz and </span><span class="c2 c7">B</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;= 0.938 </span><img src="images/image39.png"><span class="c2">&nbsp;0.0155.

When comparing data collected for the diatomic wire against the expected values, the analytical expression had a reduced chi square of 3.47 whereas the matrix eigenvalue equation that does not account for the mass of the wire had a reduced chi square of 0.513 and the matrix eigenvalue equation that does account for the mass of the wire had a reduced chi square of 1.27. It was determined that at higher frequencies the analytical expression could not correctly determine the resonant frequencies because the wavelengths were too small. However, the matrix eigenvalue equation is able to calculate those larger frequencies. For the monatomic wire with an odd mass, it is expected that the odd mass affects the resonant frequencies that have nearby antinodes to it. When comparing data collected against the expected values, the matrix eigenvalue equation that does not account for the mass of the wire had a reduced chi square of 0.498 and the matrix eigenvalue equation that does account for the mass of the wire had a reduced chi square of 0.867. Overall, it was determined that using the matrix eigenvector equation is more accurate compared to the analytical expression since it can calculate the higher frequencies with lower wavelengths. The matrix also allows us to account for the mass of the wire, but future calculations need to account for the tension of the wire.</span></p></body></html>
